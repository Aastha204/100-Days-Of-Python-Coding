# Day 7: Exploring Operators in Python

Welcome to Day 7 of my 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge! Today, I delved into understanding the various types of operators available in Python.

## What I Explored

### Types of Operators
I learned about different categories of operators in Python:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulus (`%`), Exponentiation (`**`), Floor Division (`//`).
- **Comparison Operators**: Equality (`==`), Inequality (`!=`), Greater Than (`>`), Less Than (`<`), Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`), Less Than or Equal To (`<=`).
- **Logical Operators**: AND (`and`), OR (`or`), NOT (`not`).
- **Assignment Operators**: Assigning values using `=`, combined with arithmetic operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.).
- **Bitwise Operators**: Manipulating binary numbers (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`).

### Operator Precedence
I understood the order of operations or precedence of operators in Python, which determines the sequence in which expressions are evaluated.

## Highlights
- **Diverse Operator Usage**: Realizing the broad spectrum of operators available for different operations and computations.
- **Understanding Operator Precedence**: Grasping the importance of operator precedence in writing concise and effective code.

## Next Steps
- **Hands-On Practice**: Applying operator knowledge through coding exercises to reinforce understanding.
- **Practical Implementation**: Utilizing operators in solving real-world problems or projects to strengthen skills.

## Resources
- Code with Harry tutorials on operators in Python for comprehensive coverage.
- Python official documentation on operators and expressions for a deeper understanding.

Join me on this coding journey as we continue to explore Python's functionalities and enhance our programming skills!

Happy Coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
