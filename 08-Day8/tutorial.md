# Day 8: Basic Calculator in Python

Welcome to Day 8 of my 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge! Today, I successfully created a basic calculator script in Python.

## Calculator Script Overview

### Description
The calculator script I've developed performs various arithmetic operations on predefined values `a` and `b`. It supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and floor division.

### How to Use
- **Predefined Values**: The values of `a` and `b` are preset within the script.
- **Execution**: Run the script to observe the results of different arithmetic operations printed to the console.

### Future Plans
- **Enhancements**: I plan to implement user input functionality, error handling for division by zero, and organize operations into functions for better code structure.
- **Additional Operations**: Exploring the addition of more advanced operations or functionalities to the calculator.

Feel free to explore and use the calculator script or check out other projects in this repository.

Happy Coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
