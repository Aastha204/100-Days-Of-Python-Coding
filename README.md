# 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge repository! ðŸš€ This repository documents my journey as I progress from beginner to advanced levels in Python programming.

## About
This challenge is inspired by the 'Code with Harry' YouTube channel, and I'm dedicated to spending 100 days consistently coding in Python. From fundamental concepts to more complex algorithms and projects, I aim to enhance my skills and understanding of Python through daily coding exercises.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a day of my coding journey. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- **Code**: Python scripts and projects completed on that particular day.
- **Notes**: Documentation or notes that I've made during the learning process.

## Progress
- **Day 1-10**: Basic Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Day 11-50**: Intermediate concepts like functions, modules, and file handling.
- **Day 51-100**: Advanced topics such as algorithms, data structures, and building projects.

## Resources
Throughout this challenge, I'll be referring to various resources, including online tutorials, documentation, and educational materials. Some notable references include:
- Code with Harry YouTube channel.
- Python official documentation.
- Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes.

## Goal
By the end of this 100-day journey, I aim to have a solid understanding of Python programming concepts, improved problem-solving skills, and the ability to develop practical applications using Python.
